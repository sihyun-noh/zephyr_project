  This allows you to define a group of relays. Each relay in the group is
  controlled by a GPIO. Each relay is defined in a child node of the
  gpio-relay node.

  Here is an example which defines a relay in the node /relays:

  / {
  	relays {
  		compatible = "gpio-relays";
  		realy_0 {
  			gpios = <&gpio0 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
  		};
  	};
  };

compatible: "gpio-relays"

child-binding:
  description: GPIO relay child node
  properties:
    gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
    label:
      type: string
      description: |
        Human readable string describing the relay. It can be used by an
        application to identify this relay or to retrieve its number/index
        (i.e. child node number) on the parent device.
